The bookshelf for my reading books

This repository contains a collections of books that we have read or plan to read.
We will manage these books using Git submodules to keep track of different editions and versions.

## Memo

- To add a new book, use the following command:
    ```bash
    git submodule add <repository_url> <path_to_book_directory>
    ```
    Replace `<repository_url>` with the URL of the book's repository and `<path_to_book_directory>` with the desired directory name for the book.
